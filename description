### Description of the App

This NFT Marketplace DApp allows users to create, buy, and sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can mint new NFTs by providing a unique token URI and setting a price in Ether. Once minted, the NFTs will be listed in the marketplace where other users can view and purchase them.

2. **Token Price**: This is the price at which you want to sell your NFT. It is set in Ether.

### Example Input Values
